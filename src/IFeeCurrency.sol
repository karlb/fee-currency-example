/**
 * @notice This interface should be implemented for tokens which are supposed to
 * act as fee currencies on the Celo blockchain, meaning that they can be
 * used to pay gas fees for CIP-64 transactions (and some older tx types).
 * See https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0064.md
 * 
 * @notice Before executing a tx with non-empty `feeCurrency` field, the fee
 * currency's `debitGasFees` function is called to reserve the maximum
 * amount of gas token that tx can spend. After the tx has been executed, the
 * `creditGasFees` function is called to refund any unused gas and credit
 * the spent fees to the appropriate recipients. Events which are emitted in
 * these functions will show up for every tx using the token as a
 * fee currency.
 * 
 * @dev Requirements:
 * - The functions will be called by the blockchain client with `msg.sender
 * == address(0)`. If this condition is not met, the functions must
 * revert to prevent malicious users from crediting their accounts directly.
 * - `creditGasFees` must credit all specified amounts. If this is not
 * possible the functions must revert to prevent inconsistencies between
 * the debited and credited amounts.
 * 
 * @dev Notes on compatibility:
 * - There are two versions of `creditGasFees`: one for the current
 * (2024-01-16) blockchain implementation and a more future-proof version
 * that omits deprecated fields and accommodates potential new recipients
 * that might become necessary on later blockchain implementations. Both
 * versions should be implemented to increase compatibility.
